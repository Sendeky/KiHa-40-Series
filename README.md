# KiHa-40-Series
A 3D model of the KiHa 40 series train made in Blender.
Can be used in Cycles or EEVEE, created with Blender 3.0
It has 44,166 polygons(faces) and 106,207 tris (triangles)

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS!!
The Wheels on the bogies have quite a few polygons, about 4,5k for each pair of wheels.
You'll need to duplicate them to be able to get the rotation correct, right now they are just INSTANCED.


PERFORMACE:
The model is fairly light on the system in solid view, can be a little slow if it's being used on older or slower hardware

Tested: Acceptable viewport performance on 2014 MacBook Pro 15 Inch (i7 2.8Ghz, Nvidia GT750M 2GB)
        Great viewport performance on 2019 MacBook Pro 16 Inch (i7 2.6Ghz, AMD Radeon Pro 5300M 4GB)
